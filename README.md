## Portfolio Website


### Technologies used
* Main languages: JavaScript (ES6) / HTML5 / CSS3
* React.js with:
	* Hooks
	* Styled Components
	* Various plugins - copy-to-clipboard, react-transitions-group, react-device-detect
* Gatsby.js to translate the site and deploy through GitHub pages
* Git / GitHub to manage the code

### Deployment
The app is deployed on GitHub pages and can be found here: https://paulcooke.github.io/

### Overview
I used the production of this site to learn more about a few different technologies:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">React Hooks</span>

Most my prior projects with React have used class-based components, and while I had been practising Hooks, this project involved learning custom hooks (there are two: useHover and useCopyEmail).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Gatsby</span>

I had been wanting to try out Gatsby and needed a suitable project. Once I saw deployment through GitHub pages was possible I decided that's how I'd put the site live.

### Wins
* Learning Custom Hooks
* Learning Gatsby

### Challenges

* useHover was tricky, I used several references and had to play with it quite a bit to get the result I wanted, and for it to work nicely when the hoverable/interchangeable components are mapped
* Learning to use react-transition-group alongside styled-components

### Future changes & features I would like to add to this version of the site
* I would like to use Gatsby's image features properly, with GraphQL
* I will likely adjust and tinker with animations and the media query sizes
